First you will need an SVN client like [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html Tortoise SVN].

Next go to your addons folder located at, "C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/*USER NAME*/garrysmod/garrysmod/addons/", and create a folder called "AdvDupe2" without the quotes. (*NOTE:* 64-bit users will be Program Files(x86) and *USER NAME* is your steam user name).

Once the SVN client is downloaded and the folder has been created; right click the AdvDupe2 folder and click "SVN Checkout...".

A window will pop up and you will enter the URL of the SVN. For standard users, you will enter: http://advdupe2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/AdvDupe2/
For users with paid hosting that do not allow .dlls you will enter, http://advdupe2.googlecode.com/svn/branch/AdvDupe2/

Once done, press ok and the svn will begin to download.

*WAIT*, you're not done yet. You need one last thing if you're a Windows user. You require the filestream module. Navigate to the bin directory at, ""C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/*USER NAME*/garrysmod/garrysmod/lua/bin/", _if you do not have a lua or bin folder then create them_. Right click a blank space in the folder and click SVN Checkout... again and this time enter this URL: http://advdupe2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lua/bin/gmsv_ad2filestream_win32.dll and press ok.

Once all of this has been done you should be good to go. When you first load into a map, check your console for errors about advdupe2 to make sure you installed everything correctly.
